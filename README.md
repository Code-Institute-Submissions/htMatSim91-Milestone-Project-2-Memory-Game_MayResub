Color's Memory Game was created for kids from age 3-6 years but even adults can enjoy playing! Memory games help building thinking skills, improving the concentration, improving the memory, attention, and persistence. The benefits are wide, especially as everyone needs to have the brain constantly stimulated by learning new things so this is a great experience for kids while they can have fun playing.

# Testing

- All the links and  were tested thoroughly.

- The website was tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, both on Windows and Mac OS.

- Through the Console device toolbar it was also tested using the following emulated devices: Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, iPhone 5/SE iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro, Surface Duo.

- Used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) for testing different viewports and a [Mockup Generator](http://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php) to create the image being used on the top of this readme.

- The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project:

    -   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmatsim91.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1-One-Porcent%2F) - I have validated using Direct Input from each HTML page and by URL.

    -   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmatsim91.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1-One-Porcent%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) - I have validated CSS using Direct Input and by URL. OBS: There is 10 warning due to some -webkits added on CSS, they were imported from external libraries and are needed to add interactivity.

## Bugs and Fixes

1. While creating the Modal pop-up in the index.html page the modal was not appearing on the browser. 
	1.1 Fix: After closer look it was because bootstrap was interfering with the classes modal-container, modal_container and modal. I have updated these classes name and it fixed the bug.

2. While trying to load the Font Awesome Icon there was an error and the Icon was not appearing. I was using a CDN as a source to load the Icon.
    2.1 Fix: I was able to fix this by creating an account with Font Awesome and adding the script source references that they have reccomended.

3. While running the JavaScript code through a validator it showed that a few semicolons were missing and a few typos.
    3.1 Fix: Added semicolons to the missing lines and fixed the typos.

4. While trying to run the game it was not running properly.
    4.1 Fix: While checking why I the game source on the gamt.html page was incorrect. After I updated it fixed the problem.

# Deployment

- For this project, I have used the cloud-based IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) as a free git repository hosting.

    1. I started the project by creating a new Repository on GitHub and loading the [Code Institute Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

    2. Installed the [Gitpod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) and on my GitHub repo I clicked on the Gitpod button to create a new Master Workspace on GitPod.

    3. After creating the workspace I developed the website using Gitpod and pushing my commits to GitHub using the following commands:
        - `git add "file-name"` - To add a file for staging.
        - `git commit -m "description-of-update"` - To commit.
        - `git push` - To push my commits to GitHub
        - I have also used extra git commands such as: 
        - `python3 -m http.server` - To run a preview of the website on the browser.
        - `git status` - To display the current state of the working directory and the staging area.
